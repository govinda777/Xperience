`build.rollupOptions.external`
Additionally, handling the error in the 'buildEnd' hook caused the following error:
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "unenv/node/process" from "/home/runner/work/Xperience/Xperience/node_modules/react/jsx-runtime.js".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
