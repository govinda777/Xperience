# BDD Test Planning - Payment Checkout

## Overview
This document outlines the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) test scenarios for the payment checkout process. Tests are categorized as Critical (required for pre-push) and Non-Critical (optional for pre-push) to ensure proper test execution and reporting.

## Test Categories

### üî¥ Critical Tests (Required for Pre-push)
These tests MUST pass before any code push is allowed.

#### Payment Flow
```gherkin
Feature: Critical Payment Processing

Scenario: Successful payment with valid credit card
  Given the user has items in the cart
  And the user is on the checkout page
  When the user enters valid credit card information
  And submits the payment
  Then the payment should be processed successfully
  And an order confirmation should be displayed

Scenario: Payment with insufficient funds
  Given the user has items in the cart
  And the user is on the checkout page
  When the user enters a credit card with insufficient funds
  And submits the payment
  Then an appropriate error message should be displayed
  And the user should be able to try another payment method

Scenario: Payment gateway timeout handling
  Given the user is attempting to make a payment
  When the payment gateway times out
  Then the system should handle the timeout gracefully
  And display an appropriate error message
  And not charge the customer
```

#### Security Validations
```gherkin
Feature: Critical Security Checks

Scenario: Credit card data encryption
  Given the user enters credit card information
  When the data is transmitted
  Then all sensitive data should be properly encrypted
  And no plain text card information should be logged

Scenario: Payment fraud detection
  Given a user attempts a payment
  When suspicious activity is detected
  Then the transaction should be blocked
  And the security team should be notified
```

### üü° Non-Critical Tests (Optional for Pre-push)
These tests are important but not blocking for pre-push.

#### User Experience
```gherkin
Feature: Payment UX Validations

Scenario: Save payment method for future use
  Given the user completes a successful payment
  When prompted to save payment information
  And the user accepts
  Then the payment method should be saved securely
  And available for future purchases

Scenario: Payment method selection UI
  Given the user is on the checkout page
  When viewing payment methods
  Then all available payment options should be clearly displayed
  And the user should be able to switch between them
```

#### Edge Cases
```gherkin
Feature: Payment Edge Cases

Scenario: Network reconnection during payment
  Given the user loses internet connection during payment
  When the connection is restored
  Then the payment process should resume or restart safely
  And the user should be informed of the status

Scenario: Multiple currency support
  Given the user selects a different currency
  When proceeding with the payment
  Then the correct currency conversion should be applied
  And displayed clearly to the user
```

## Test Execution and Reporting

### Pre-push Validation
1. All Critical Tests must pass (üî¥)
   - Payment Flow scenarios
   - Security Validation scenarios
2. Non-Critical Tests (üü°) are executed but do not block the push

### Test Report Format
```
Test Execution Summary:
‚úÖ Critical Tests: [Passed/Total]
‚ÑπÔ∏è Non-Critical Tests: [Passed/Total]

Critical Test Details:
üî¥ Payment Flow: [Status]
üî¥ Security Validations: [Status]

Non-Critical Test Details:
üü° User Experience: [Status]
üü° Edge Cases: [Status]
```

### Failed Test Handling
1. Critical Test Failures:
   - Block the push
   - Require immediate attention
   - Send notification to the development team

2. Non-Critical Test Failures:
   - Create tickets for follow-up
   - Do not block the push
   - Include in technical debt tracking

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Tags
- Use `@critical` tag for critical tests
- Use `@non-critical` tag for non-critical tests
- Example:
  ```gherkin
  @critical
  Scenario: Successful payment with valid credit card
  ```

### Reporting Integration
- Configure CI/CD pipeline to parse test results
- Generate separate reports for critical and non-critical tests
- Include test execution time and failure details
- Store historical test results for trend analysis

### Best Practices
1. Keep scenarios focused and atomic
2. Use clear, business-oriented language
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions
4. Regular review and update of test scenarios
5. Document any test data requirements

## Maintenance
- Regular review of test categorization
- Update scenarios based on new features
- Archive obsolete tests
- Monitor test execution times
- Review and optimize slow tests
